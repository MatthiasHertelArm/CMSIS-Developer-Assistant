/**
 * The machine-wide list of CMSIS Developer Assistant windows. Each window
 * keeps one small JSON file in a shared temp directory that says how to reach
 * its control server, which folders it has open and whether it is debugging;
 * the router window reads them all to decide where a tool call runs.
 *
 * The file format is shared by every installed version of the extension, so
 * windows of different versions can find each other: keep it stable, and
 * ignore fields you do not know. Readers tidy up as they go, dropping entries
 * of processes that are gone and entries that stopped being refreshed. The
 * one exception is the router's entry (#14): while its process lives it is
 * only skipped, so that the other windows can tell that the window holding
 * the MCP port has stopped running (`findStaleRouter`).
 *
 * Since 2.5.1 an entry also says what the window is doing: its role, the
 * extension version, the event-loop delay of the last heartbeat interval and
 * the agent calls running there for more than 10 s (#14).
 *
 * The files carry each window's control token, so only this user may read
 * them (#19): the directory is 0700 and the files 0600. Where the temp
 * directory is shared by all users (Linux /tmp) the directory name carries
 * the uid (`resolveRegistryDir`); a directory that is a symbolic link or
 * belongs to someone else is not used at all (`ensureRegistryDir`), and the
 * window then works on its own.
 *
 * Beside the window files the directory holds `default-target.json`: the
 * window the user chose with Select Target Window (#16) for agent calls
 * that nothing else aims. Readers of older versions skip it by its name.
