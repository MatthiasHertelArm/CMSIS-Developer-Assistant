/**
 * Writing the tool rules into agents' rule files, taking them out again, and
 * keeping them current (#50 part 2, #45). The steps are the same whoever
 * drives them: the setup step in agentConfigurationManager.ts with VS Code's
 * picker and diff editor, the unit tests with an in-memory file system and
 * scripted answers.
 *
 * - `runRuleStep()`: offer the files, then apply what was checked or
 *   unchecked, one previewed and confirmed change at a time. A change the
 *   user does not confirm writes nothing.
 * - `refreshRecordedRules()`: at activation, update every recorded block
 *   whose text is not the current contract's, in place. It never creates a
 *   block or a file.
 *
 * The files the rules went into are recorded (`RuleRecordStore`, globalState
 * in the extension): a removal needs to know whether the file and its
 * directories were made for the rules, and activation needs to know which
 * blocks to keep current. The rules text and the file map come from
 * src/core/agentRules.ts. No vscode import.
