/**
 * What an agent sees of one MCP session: the server identity and
 * instructions (their text is in core/serverInstructions.ts), the debugging,
 * serial and window-routing tools (the documentation and build-artefact
 * groups come from their own modules), and the Markdown shipped under docs/
 * as resources.
 *
 * `buildSessionServer` assembles it once per session. The gates read the
 * server options and the session's handlers at that moment only, so the tool
 * list a client caches stays true for the whole session.
 *
 * Every tool hands its parsed arguments to one handler method and replies
 * with that method's outcome through `reply()`. Nothing is caught here: a
 * failure reaches `MeasuredMcpServer`, which answers it as a typed error
 * result with `isError`, and counts it.
