 * Where each agent reads always-on instructions, checked against the vendors'
 * documentation on 2026-09-24:
 *
 * - Claude Code: user file `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/CLAUDE.md`, default
 *   `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` ("The user memory file (CLAUDE.md) ... move with
 *   it", https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars). In a project it reads
 *   `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and reads `AGENTS.md` instead only
 *   while none of `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md`
 *   exists (v2.1.277 and later, https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory).
 * - Codex: `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md`, default `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, and per
 *   directory from the git root down; in each place a non-empty
 *   `AGENTS.override.md` is read instead of `AGENTS.md`
 *   (https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md, where
 *   developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md redirects).
 * - GitHub Copilot CLI: `$COPILOT_HOME/copilot-instructions.md`, default
 *   `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`; in a repository `AGENTS.md`,
 *   `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
 *   (https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions).
 * - Antigravity: `~/.gemini/AGENTS.md` or `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` for every
 *   project, `AGENTS.md` or `GEMINI.md` per directory, always on
 *   (https://antigravity.google/docs/rules). Unverified: which of the two
 *   user files wins when both exist; `~/.gemini/AGENTS.md` is not read by
 *   Gemini CLI, which shares `~/.gemini`, so the rules stay with Antigravity.
 * - VS Code Copilot Chat: the workspace `AGENTS.md` (`chat.useAgentsMdFile`,
 *   default true) and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
 *   (`github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles`, default true)
 *   (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions,
 *   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/copilot-settings).
 * - Cursor: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`; `alwaysApply: true` in the frontmatter
 *   includes a rule in every chat, and a plain `.md` there is ignored.
 *   Cursor also reads `AGENTS.md`; its User Rules are a setting, not a file
 *   (https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules).
 * - Cline: every file in `.clinerules/` or `.cline/rules/`; it also detects
 *   `AGENTS.md`, behind a toggle whose default the documentation does not
 *   state (unverified) (https://docs.cline.bot/features/cline-rules).
 * - Roo Code: every file in `.roo/rules/`, recursively; a single `.roorules`
 *   only while `.roo/rules/` is missing or empty; `AGENTS.md` by default
 *   (`roo-cline.useAgentRules`)
 *   (https://roocodeinc.github.io/Roo-Code/features/custom-instructions,
 *   where docs.roocode.com redirects).
 *
 * Offered here, as proposal 50 decided: the user file of Claude Code, Codex
 * and Copilot CLI, preselected, because their MCP registration is per user
 * too; the same for Antigravity, whose user file the proposal could not name
 * yet. Copilot Chat, Cursor, Cline and Roo Code get their workspace file only.
