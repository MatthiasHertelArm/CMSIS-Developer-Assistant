/**
 * The tool contract (#50): the rules that keep agents on the MCP tools rather
 * than pyocd, gdb, cbuild or a serial terminal in the shell, and the table of
 * shell commands with the tool that replaces each.
 *
 * docs/agent-resources/tool-contract.md is the only place the text is
 * written. Its two sections sit between marker pairs (src/utils/markerBlock.ts);
 * the MCP server leads its instructions with the rules, and
 * `npm run skills:sync` copies the blocks into every file of
 * `CONTRACT_COPIES` and into the generated cmsis-help skill, where
 * src/test/toolContract.test.ts compares them with the source. Pure: no I/O,
 * no vscode.
