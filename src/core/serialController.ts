/**
 * Programmatic serial port controller — own a connection independent of the
 * Serial Monitor UI extension. Buffers RX data so an MCP client can poll/read
 * it on demand. Use this when the user is NOT running an MS Serial Monitor
 * session for the same port (the OS only allows one reader per tty in the
 * default mode). One owned port per window.
 *
 * The state follows the port, not only `close()`: when the port closes by
 * itself (the adapter was unplugged) or fails after it closed, the controller
 * forgets it, keeps the received bytes readable, and remembers why as
 * `lastRelease`, which the serial tools name (#49). Tests build their own
 * controller over serialport's `SerialPortMock`, a fixed clock and hand-driven
 * timers; the extension uses the `serialController` singleton.
 *
 * A port is held under a lease (src/core/serialLease.ts, #49): the MCP session
 * that opened it and the rule that lets it go — after the idle time, when its
 * session ends, when a debug session ends — besides `close()`, the user's
 * Release command and the window's teardown. Every such release and every
 * unplug is journaled in the window's problem journal (#48, source `serial`),
 * as a warning for an unplug and for the user's release and as info
 * otherwise, without any payload. So is a port that cannot be opened;
 * another program holding it is `PORT_HELD`.
