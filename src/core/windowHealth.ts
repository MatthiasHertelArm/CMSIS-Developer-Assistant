/**
 * What a window knows about its own health (#14), for the control server's
 * fence and `health` op, the registry entry and the notices:
 *
 * - `BusyTable`: the ops running in this window, with when each started and
 *   whether it outlived its fence. An op stays in it until its promise
 *   settles, however long after its fence that is.
 * - `LagMonitor`: how late the event loop ran timers since the last reset,
 *   from `perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay`. A blocked extension host shows
 *   here, afterwards, as a delay of seconds.
 * - `NoticeGate`: at most one notice per key in a time window, so a picker
 *   nobody answers does not raise a toast per call.
 * - The registry's view: the calls busy for more than 10 s and the lag, as
 *   an entry stores them and as `list_debug_windows` shows them.
 * - `RouterWatch` and `portSilent`: whether the window that holds the MCP
 *   port has stopped running, judged by a worker whose promotion failed.
 * - `probeLoopback`: one request on a connection of its own, waiting only
 *   for the first sign of an answer; the router's health check and
 *   `portSilent` both use it.
 *
 * Pure: Node only, no vscode.
