/**
 * A wedged probe, told apart from an address that cannot be read (#3,
 * phase 1).
 *
 * When a memory read fails on the CMSIS Debugger, the executor reads DHCSR
 * (0xE000EDF0, 4 bytes, DAP `readMemory`, at most 1 s) once. A debugger can
 * read DHCSR on every Cortex-M while the debug port works, so
 * `classifyReadFailure` decides:
 *
 *   - DHCSR unreadable, or timed out: the probe or its GDB server is wedged,
 *     `PROBE_WEDGED`, with the cause of every read strategy kept;
 *   - DHCSR readable after a failed read: the address is not readable in this
 *     state, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`;
 *   - DHCSR readable after a read that timed out: the read was only slow, and
 *     its timeout stands;
 *   - DHCSR refused because the target runs: `TARGET_RUNNING`, not a wedge.
 *
 * A readable DHCSR with S_LOCKUP adds a lockup note to the fault tools.
 *
 * The way out depends on who owns the GDB server (`wedgeHint`): an attached
 * session reconnects with `cmsis_action detach` and `attach`, which does not
 * reset; a launched session owns its server, so keeping the fault state takes
 * a server restarted without a reset — by the user, since agents do not start
 * GDB servers. Nothing here retries or reconnects on its own: a reconnect
 * replaces the debug session and must not happen as a side effect of a read.
 *
 * Pure: no `vscode`.
