/**
 * The error lines of a failed CMSIS build (#15), and the check of a build
 * that exited 0.
 *
 * When a build job of the window's CMSIS job tracker settles as failed with
 * an exit code other than 0, `attachBuildDiagnosis` hands the tracker the
 * work that completes the job's result (`CmsisJobTracker.completeWith`). The
 * failing `cmsis_action build` call shows the lines if they arrive within its
 * deadline; `cmsis_action {action:'status'}` shows them afterwards.
 *
 * A build that exited 0 is checked the same way before it counts as a
 * success: CMSIS Solution 1.70.1 closes its build task with 0 whatever cbuild
 * returned (its `BuildRunner` ignores the exit code the toolbox manager
 * hands back, and the pseudoterminal then closes with 0). Errors in a fresh
 * cbuild-idx.yml make it a failure; images all written since the build
 * started confirm it; otherwise stage B below decides — its re-run fails
 * where the build failed and succeeds when there was nothing to rebuild —
 * and when it cannot run, the result says the build is not confirmed.
 *
 *   1. Stage A reads the `messages` of the solution's `*.cbuild-idx.yml`
 *      (in the solution directory, or under CMSIS Solution's `--output`
 *      prefix) when the file was written after the build started. Errors
 *      there — missing packs or components, schema errors — are the answer,
 *      labelled "from csolution", and nothing is re-run. Stage A always runs.
 *   2. Stage B runs cbuild once more with `--log` into
 *      `<solutionDir>/out/cmsis-developer-assistant/build-diagnostic.log`,
 *      with the arguments of `cbuildDiagnosticArgs` (no pack download, no
 *      RTE update, no clean; `--skip-convert` after a fresh index), in the
 *      environment of `.cmsis/tools-environment.yml` with the extension's
 *      pack root. The build is incremental: what compiled before is up to
 *      date, and the failing translation unit fails again.
 *
 * Guards of the re-run: the setting `cmsis-developer-assistant.build.diagnosticRerun`
 * (window scope, read for every failure); no shell; a cap of 120 s; it
 * starts only while no other `cmsis-csolution.build` execution (build or
 * setup) is alive, and one that starts meanwhile kills it and everything it
 * started. A missing environment file or cbuild, or the setting off, is said
 * in the result, which then names `get_build_diagnostics`.
 *
 * Assumed, not yet confirmed on a live installation (this was written
 * without hardware or network):
 *   - `cbuild … --skip-convert --log <file>` still runs cbuild2cmake, CMake
 *     and ninja, and the log carries the compiler's lines; the output cbuild
 *     prints is parsed as well, in case the log does not;
 *   - the environment of tools-environment.yml plus `CMSIS_PACK_ROOT`
 *     reproduces the extension's own build on macOS and Windows;
 *   - CMSIS Solution does not write build outputs from its csolution RPC
 *     while the re-run builds (only its build tasks are watched).
 *
 * Everything outside VS Code and the file system comes through a
 * `DiagnosisHost`; tests give it a fake spawn, a hand-moved clock and fixed
 * settings, and `vscodeDiagnosisHost` is the real one.
