/**
 * Does the cmsis-debug-live skill trigger? A live check against a real
 * GitHub Copilot CLI:
 *
 *   npm run test:skill-trigger-agent
 *   npm run test:skill-trigger-agent -- "The UART stops transmitting after the first DMA transfer"
 *
 * A scratch git worktree of HEAD gets the skill from the working tree
 * (uncommitted edits included) as a project skill. One non-interactive
 * Copilot session then runs there with a "it does not work on the board"
 * prompt, and the check passes when the agent's very first tool call loads
 * the skill. The worktree and its temporary directory are removed however
 * the run ends; a failure is thrown and ends the process non-zero.
 *
 * Not part of `npm test`: it needs an authenticated Copilot CLI, costs AI
 * credits, and a model's first move is not deterministic. The wording the
 * trigger depends on is pinned by src/test/debugSkillGuidance.test.ts.
