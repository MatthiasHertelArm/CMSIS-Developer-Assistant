name: cmsis-debug-live
description: Drive a live Arm Cortex-M debug session through the CMSIS Debugger to investigate firmware runtime bugs — HardFaults and other faults, crashes, hangs, failing tests, peripherals that do not respond, wrong/null values that are right in simulation but wrong on hardware, unexpected output, code that never reaches the line you expect, timing that does not close. Prefer it as the first investigation step whenever live inspection is practical, and use it instead of adding temporary printf/UART logging, LED toggles, or console output to diagnose firmware — halting the CPU and looking is cheaper and does not perturb the target the way a reflash with extra prints does. Pairs with the CMSIS Developer Assistant MCP server, which exposes the breakpoint / step / memory / register / peripheral tools.

# CMSIS Developer Assistant — Live Cortex-M Debugging

<!-- cmsis-developer-assistant:rules:begin -->
## CMSIS Developer Assistant tool rules

Only the user can lift a rule, by asking for the specific command.

- Talk to the board only through the cmsis-developer-assistant MCP tools. Never run `pyocd`, `gdb`, `JLinkExe`, `JLinkGDBServer` or `openocd` against the board from a shell, and never install pyOCD.
- Build, load, erase, run and debug with `cmsis_action`; program with `flash`. Run `cbuild`, `csolution` or `cpackget` in a shell only when the user asks for it or a CMSIS skill step names the command.
- Serial I/O only through the `serial_*` tools, not `screen`, `cat /dev/tty*` or a serial script.
- Manuals, datasheets and register meanings through the documentation tools; use the web only to find a PDF URL for `fetch_doc`, and never read a PDF into your context.
- Symbol, section, memory-usage and build-log questions through the build-artefact tools, not `nm`, `size` or a grep over the map file.
- If a tool you need is not in your tool list, name the setting that enables it (`cmsis-developer-assistant.packDocs.enabled` or `cmsis-developer-assistant.buildInfo.enabled`) instead of substituting a shell command.
- The control server and the registry files are internal: never call or read them. With several VS Code windows open, use `list_debug_windows` and `select_debug_window`.
- A running target rejects reads and steps: call `pause_execution` first.
- If a tool fails twice, call `get_session_status`, then stop and tell the user what to do in VS Code. Do not work around a failing tool with a shell command.

## Shell commands and the tools that replace them

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `pyocd load`, `pyocd flash` | `flash`, or `cmsis_action load` |
| `pyocd reset`, `monitor reset` | `reset`, which verifies that the target did reset |
| `pyocd gdbserver`, `JLinkGDBServer`, `openocd`, `arm-none-eabi-gdb` | `cmsis_action load_and_debug`, or `cmsis_action attach` for firmware started with `cmsis_action load_and_run` |
| `pyocd commander`, `gdb -ex "x/…"` | `read_memory`, `read_core_registers`, `evaluate_expression` |
| `pyocd list`, `JLinkExe` to check the probe | `check_target_connection`, `get_session_status` |
| `pip install pyocd` | nothing to install: `flash` uses the pyOCD bundled with the CMSIS Debugger, then the one `.cmsis/tools-environment.yml` names, then PATH |
| `cbuild …` | `cmsis_action build` |
| `arm-none-eabi-nm`, `readelf -s` | `lookup_symbol` |
| `arm-none-eabi-size`, a grep over the `.map` file | `get_memory_usage`, `get_section_layout` |
| a grep over the build log | `get_build_diagnostics` |
| `screen /dev/tty…`, `cat /dev/tty…`, a pyserial script | `serial_open`, `serial_read`, `serial_write`; `serial_subscribe_monitor` while the Serial Monitor holds the port |
| `curl localhost:<port>` with the registry token | `list_debug_windows`, `select_debug_window` |
| reading a PDF, a web search for a register | `list_target_docs`, `search_target_docs`, `read_doc_pages`, `fetch_doc`, `get_peripheral_docs`, `lookup_register` |

## Why embedded debugging is different

Embedded debugging differs from host debugging in ways that change the workflow,
not just the tool names:

- **The target is one physical thing.** There is no "run it again with a print".
  Halting the CPU stops the world — timers, DMA, and the peripherals' notion of
  time. What you observe is changed by observing it.
- **Symbols are not the whole story.** A value can be right in the debugger and
  wrong in the peripheral, because the write went to the wrong alias, was
  optimised out, or landed in a cache the peripheral cannot see.
- **The probe can wedge.** A failed read may mean the memory is inaccessible,
  or that the debug link is gone. Those need different responses.

> The `allowed-tools` list uses the tool names the CMSIS Developer Assistant server
> registers. Some runtimes namespace them (`mcp__cmsis-developer-assistant__read_memory`);
> adapt as needed.

## Before anything else: know your target

Do not set a breakpoint before you know what you are attached to. Read, in this
order, and stop as soon as you have the device, core, ELF path and probe:

1. `<name>.csolution.yml` — contexts, packs, board.
2. `<name>.cbuild-idx.yml` — index of built contexts. **Start here** to find the
   active artifacts.
3. `out/<context>.cbuild.yml` — device, core, ELF path, defines.
4. `out/<context>.cbuild-run.yml` — GDB server, port, flash algorithms, reset
   sequences, **SVD path**.
5. `.vscode/launch.json` — the `type: gdbtarget` entry whose `name` you would
   pass as `configurationName`.

A solution can declare several `target-types` (board and FVP, the HE and HP
cores of a dual-core device); `cmsis_action` acts on the one the CMSIS
Solution panel has selected, and every reply names it (`… on HP@debug`).
On a multi-target solution pass `target` (`MPS3` or `HP@debug`): a differing
target is switched and verified before anything runs, an undeclared one is
refused with the declared list.

If those files are missing, build first (`cmsis_action` with `action='build'`).
It waits for cbuild and ends with ✅ or ❌ plus the exit code and a job id —
read that line rather than polling for output files. Pack resolution or a
first build can outlast the call's wait (60 s by default; `timeoutMs` up to
600000 for `cmsis_action` and `flash`, 60000 for the other tools). The reply
then has status `running` and names the job: call `cmsis_action` with
`action='status'` for the result, and never start the build again to learn
it — a repeated build attaches to the one in flight.

`load_and_run` leaves the CMSIS Run task holding the probe (it hosts the GDB
server): `attach` debugs that firmware, and `cmsis_action` `stop_run` frees
the probe before `load`, `load_and_debug` or `flash`. A `PROBE_BUSY` error
names what holds the probe and the step to take. `flash` uses the CMSIS
Debugger's bundled pyOCD — never install one.
If `launch.json` is stale, the user has to regenerate it: **CMSIS Solution →
Manage Solution → Debugger → Apply**. You cannot do that step for them.

`get_debug_instructions` with `topic: 'build'` returns the full version of this,
including the pack documentation notes; without `topic` it returns a short
overview and the list of topics (`session`, `build`, `breakpoints`,
`inspection`, `faults`, `troubleshooting`).

---

## Session state gates everything

Call `get_session_status` before any session-changing tool. It never hangs and
never throws.

| State | Correct next action |
|-------|---------------------|
| `no-session` | `cmsis_action load_and_debug` for CMSIS projects — builds, flashes, attaches. `start_debugging` only for non-CMSIS targets, or to attach without reflashing. |
| `initializing` | Wait, ask again. Do **not** issue a second start. |
| `stopped` | Inspect freely. |
| `running` | Reads and steps will be rejected. `pause_execution`, or set a breakpoint (the tool pauses the target briefly to apply it) and `wait_for_stop`. |
| `unresponsive` | `check_target_connection`, then `restart_debugging`. More reads will only time out. |

`running` rejects `step_over`, `step_into`, `step_out`, `continue_execution`,
`read_memory`, `read_core_registers`, `read_peripheral_register`,
`read_cycle_counter`, `get_fault_info`, `diagnose_fault`,
`evaluate_expression`, `get_call_stack`, `get_frame_variables`,
`get_threads`, `list_variable_names` and `get_variables_values`: call
`pause_execution` first.

`reset` verifies the PC against the reset vector. When it says the target did
NOT reset (common with J-Link and on secure-boot parts such as Alif Ensemble,
where nSRST alone does not re-vector the core), `stop_debugging`, then
`cmsis_action load_and_debug`. Power-cycle only if that fails too.

`start_debugging` and `cmsis_action load_and_debug` refuse when a session is
already live, so checking first saves a round trip.

## Reading results

- A failed call is marked `isError`; its text starts with the code in brackets
  (`[NO_SESSION]`, `[TARGET_RUNNING]`, `[TIMEOUT]`, `[PROBE_BUSY]`, …), which
  `structuredContent.error_code` repeats.
- The line after the message is the hint — the next call to make. Follow it
  rather than repeating the failed call.
- `structuredContent.status` `timeout` (a wait ran out, the target still runs)
  and `running` (a build or attach goes on) are not failures.
- A result without `isError` and without a status is a plain success.

## Debugger first — do not start by adding prints

Do not begin a runtime investigation by editing the firmware to add `printf`
over UART or ITM, LED toggles, trace macros, or other temporary instrumentation.
On a Cortex-M that costs a rebuild, a reflash and a reset cycle per hypothesis,
it moves code and data around, and it changes the timing of exactly the thing
you are trying to observe. Instead:

1. Invoke this skill.
2. Check `get_session_status`, then set a breakpoint and inspect the live state —
   variables, registers, memory, peripherals.
3. When a hot loop or an ISR must be observed without a halt per hit, remember
   that `add_logpoint` still stops the core briefly (see below); prefer
   `read_cycle_counter` around the region, or a RAM buffer the firmware fills
   and you read back with `read_memory`.
4. Add permanent logging only when observability itself is the requested change,
   not as a substitute for investigating the current bug.

If the debugger cannot be used — no probe, no `launch.json`, a board that does
not enumerate — say what the concrete blocker is before falling back to another
method.

---

---

## Core loop

1. **Breakpoint by line number.** `add_breakpoint` takes `line`. Use
   `condition` (e.g. `i == 100`, `p != 0`) rather than stopping 99 times —
   the target stops for you only when it holds. The core still halts
   briefly at every hit while GDB tests it (the FPB has no condition logic),
   which matters in an ISR or a tight loop. The answer says whether the
   debugger bound the breakpoint; one that is NOT verified never stops.
2. **Run and wait.** `continue_execution`, then `wait_for_stop` when you want an
   explicit bound. If the target never stops, the response tells you where the
   PC actually is rather than leaving you guessing.
3. **Look before you read.** `list_variable_names` shows what is in scope
   without reading values. On a slow probe that turns thirty reads into one.
4. **Read what you need.** `get_variables_values` (optionally with
   `variableNames`), `get_call_stack` then `get_frame_variables` to inspect a
   caller without disturbing the active frame. Listings without
   `variableNames` are capped (40 per scope, 200 chars per value) and say so;
   pass names to lift the cap. Motion tools return a compact state — top
   frames and the breakpoints only when they changed.
5. **Cross-check against the hardware.** A variable and the peripheral can
   disagree — see below.

### Cortex-M breakpoint budget

Breakpoints in flash use the FPB comparators: commonly **6** on Cortex-M4/M7,
**4** on Cortex-M0+. Past that, breakpoints silently fail to bind or the
adapter reports an error. `clear_all_breakpoints` between hypotheses. In RAM,
software breakpoints are unlimited.

### Logpoints are not free here

`add_logpoint` prints and resumes rather than halting — but the core still stops
on every hit while GDB formats and prints. In an ISR or a hot loop that changes
the timing you are trying to measure. For those, prefer `read_cycle_counter`
around the region, or have the firmware fill a RAM buffer you read back with
`read_memory`.

GDB infers nothing about types, so `{expr}` defaults to `%d` and you write
`{expr:%s}` / `{expr:%f}` / `{expr:%p}` when it is not an integer. On the
CMSIS Debugger a logpoint is a GDB `dprintf`: its text goes to VS Code's
Debug Console, not to you, and `list_breakpoints` counts its hits.

---

## When the variable and the hardware disagree

This is the characteristic embedded bug, and the reason the memory tools exist.

- **Read the peripheral, not the shadow copy.** `read_peripheral_register` goes
  through the SVD, so ask for `GPIOA`/`ODR` by name. If the SVD is missing, the
  `cbuild-run.yml` says where it should be.
- **Ask the SVD first.** `lookup_register` (`RCC`, `APB1ENR`) says which bit is
  the clock enable before you read anything; `lookup_peripheral` with an
  `address` turns a BFAR into a peripheral and register. Neither needs a
  session or touches the target.
- **Then the manual.** When the SVD gives a bit position but not its meaning,
  `search_target_docs` (register or bit name) and `get_peripheral_docs` answer
  from the reference manual with page cites, and `lookup_symbol` turns a fault
  PC into a function — when `cmsis-developer-assistant.packDocs.enabled` /
  `buildInfo.enabled` are on (off by default; see `$cmsis-pack-docs`). Do not
  ask the user for a manual and do not read a PDF into your context: search,
  or suggest the setting; a PDF the user provides goes into `docs/` and is
  searched. Third-party parts (sensors, ADCs, codecs) included: a part-number
  lookup starts with `list_target_docs`; the web is only for finding a PDF
  URL to hand to `fetch_doc`.
- **Read the address directly.** `read_memory` on the register address tells you
  what the bus sees. A mismatch against the C variable means the write never
  landed — wrong alias, missing `volatile`, or a peripheral clock that is off.
- **Check the clock first.** A peripheral whose clock gate is closed reads back
  zeros or retains defaults and silently ignores writes. This is the single most
  common "the peripheral is broken" cause.
- **Watch for caches and write buffers** on M7 and larger parts: what the core
  wrote may not be what DMA reads.

## When it faulted

`diagnose_fault` does the whole first pass in one call: the decoded fault
registers, the stacked exception frame (the PC of the faulting instruction and
its caller — on a stacked exception the interesting PC is in the frame, not in
the current registers), the top frames, the faulting address resolved against
the SVD, and up to three ranked hypotheses each with the next call. Read it
before theorising — it usually names the cause outright (an unclocked
peripheral at BFAR, a null pointer, a stack overflow, a missing Thumb bit).

The pieces stay available when you need one of them alone: `get_fault_info`
(CFSR/HFSR/DFSR/MMFAR/BFAR bit by bit), `read_core_registers`,
`read_memory` at PSP/MSP for the frame, `get_call_stack` to walk up,
`lookup_peripheral { address }` for an address.

If a fault read answers `PROBE_WEDGED`, the debug port no longer answers
(DHCSR could not be read either): stop reading and follow the hint. An
attach session reconnects with `cmsis_action detach`, then `attach`,
without a reset. A `load_and_debug` session owns its GDB server;
`restart_debugging` and `load_and_debug` re-flash and reset, so to keep
the fault state the user restarts the server without a reset and you
`cmsis_action attach`. Never start a GDB server yourself.
`INVALID_ARGUMENT` "the debug port answers" means only that address is
unreadable. A lockup note means the core faulted inside a fault handler.

`references/cmsis-embedded-guide.md` has the SCS memory map and the decode
recipes. `references/troubleshooting/embedded.md` covers probe-not-detected,
target-not-halted, a reset that did not take, SVD-missing and
wrong-core-on-multicore.

## When it did not reach your breakpoint

`continue_execution` that times out already pauses the target and reports where
it actually is. Read that before adding more breakpoints — firmware sitting in a
polling loop, an ISR, or a fault handler all look the same from the outside and
the PC tells them apart immediately.

## When the firmware prints

`serial_open` takes the port directly; `serial_read` drains a buffered ring. If
the user has the MS Serial Monitor open on the same device, the OS will not give
you the tty — use `serial_subscribe_monitor` instead, which taps the extension
rather than the kernel.

---

## Several VS Code windows open

The MCP server runs in one window and forwards each call to the window that owns
the target. It resolves from a file path when a tool has one, otherwise from the
window your session pinned or used last, then from the window that has an active
debug session.

`cmsis_action`, `flash`, `reset` and `serial_open` also take `window`: a pid, or
a path inside that window's workspace. It aims that call, and your later calls
without a path follow it to the same window.

When no rule decides — two windows debugging at once, or several idle ones — it
refuses to guess and asks you to choose: reading the wrong board's memory looks
exactly like a firmware bug. `list_debug_windows` shows the candidates;
`select_debug_window` pins one for the rest of the session.

---

## Root cause, not symptom

The hardware makes it tempting to stop at the first thing that looks wrong.
It usually is not the cause. And it is tempting to add a `printf` rather than
halt — do not; inspect the live state first (see *Debugger first* above).

- "The value is 0" → *why* is it 0? Which write produced it, and did that write
  reach the hardware?
- "It faults in `memcpy`" → `memcpy` is fine. Where did the bad pointer come
  from, and which frame produced it?
- "It works with a delay" → a delay that fixes something is a race or an
  uninitialised peripheral, not a fix.

You have found the root cause when you can say which line produced the wrong
state, and predict what changing it will do. Verify that prediction on the
target before you claim it.

## Clean up

`clear_all_breakpoints` when you change hypotheses — the FPB budget is small and
stale breakpoints produce confusing stops. `stop_debugging` when done, so the
probe is released.
